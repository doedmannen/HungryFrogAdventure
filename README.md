# HungryFrogAdventure
A JavaScript game for mobile devices.

You play as a very hungry frog that loves fastfood,
but you have to avoid the bombs for some reason.

This is my second project in JavaScript.


ISSUES:
If you play on PC and click with mouse2 while holding down up or down arrow,
the game will get fixed to that moveDir.

There seems to be a issue with the text "fast nation food invasion" being
a to long title to be displayed on some phones. Might need to scale that down
a bit. 

TODO:

Option to invert controller

Sound?
