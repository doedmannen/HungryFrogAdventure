# HungryFrogAdventure
A JavaScript game for mobile devices.

You play as a very hungry frog that loves fastfood,
but you have to avoid the bombs for some reason.

This is my second project in JavaScript.


ISSUES:
There seems to be a issue with the text "fast nation food invasion" being
a to long title to be displayed on some phones. Might need to scale that down
a bit.

Some smartphone users are not able to play the game since it uses mouseIsPressed
instead of native touchStarted() touchEnded(). This is primarily a problem
with devices running iOS. It should be fixed in next patch.  

TODO:

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
        The game needs to use touch instead of mouseIsPressed.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

When do we launch our first rocket?
Is the game still a bit to slow at the start?



Is the game spawning to many bombs after itemspeed is increased by X4?




No priority at the moment:


Option to invert controller


Sound?


Save highscore to browsers local storage?
